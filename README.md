# Java Koans 

Point your java variables to  JDK 8  (Java 9 works but there are a few hiccups in the new java 9 date formats!)

- Add java 8 **bin** to **path** e.g. "C:\\ProgramFiles\\Java\\jdk1.8.XXX\\bin"

Clone or download the repo <https://github.com/rudolph-est/java-koans> and open a command prompt  
Run “run.bat” in the "koans" directory  - \\koans\\run.bat

The goal is to edit and replace all the “\_\_” for each exercise with the
correct answer

You need to solve the problem to get to the next level.

For example: The first level is to fine the file AboutKoans.java:  
Delete line 11 and change line’s 16 variable to be false  
Then go to AboutAssertions and fix line 13 – replace the \_\_ with true.  
Carry on until you have completed all the exercises.
